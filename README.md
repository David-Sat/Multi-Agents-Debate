# LLM Think Tank: Pooling AI Expertise for Multi-Perspective Insights

Leveraging the power of collaboration, a main LLM instance consults a 'Think Tank' of specialized LLMs, each bringing unique domain-specific expertise to the table. This approach enriches the primary LLM's problem-solving ability while managing token limitations effectively. The project builds upon the original [MAD framework](https://github.com/Skytliang/Multi-Agents-Debate), utilizing its concept of multi-agent debate to create a more informed, diverse, and efficient dialog system.

## Specialized Multi-Agent Debate
The LLM Think Tank is a proposed solution to enhance the breadth and depth of knowledge covered by a single Large Language Model (LLM). It aims to address gaps in the LLM's ability to remain current with developments across diverse research fields.

A range of specialized LLMs, each trained in a specific field or task, constitute the Think Tank. This modular design allows for the continual integration of the latest relevant data, enhancing the contributions of each LLM.

Based on the discussion mechanism developed by the Team behind the MAD framework, the Think Tank operates by enabling discourse among specialized LLMs. Every LLM injects its domain-specific expertise into the discussion, culminating in a comprehensive, multi-perspective output.

The LLM Think Tank offers numerous benefits, including up-to-date information, efficient token use in the main LLM, and the incorporation of diverse viewpoints. In essence, it transforms the single LLM from a stand-alone knowledge source to a cooperative network of AI specialists.

The LLM Think Tank is an extension of the [Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework](https://github.com/Skytliang/Multi-Agents-Debate), originally proposed to tackle the Degeneration-of-Thought problem in Large Language Models (LLMs). 

### Benefits of the LLM Think Tank
1. **Current Information:** Constant integration of the latest relevant data through specialized LLMs.
2. **Efficient Token Use:** Reduced token usage in the main LLM due to summarized input from the Think Tank.
3. **Diverse Viewpoints:** Incorporation of diverse perspectives from multiple fields for a more comprehensive understanding.
4. **Domain-Specific Expertise:** Contributions from LLMs trained in specific fields enhance the quality of discussions.
5. **Cooperative Network:** Transformation of a single LLM from a stand-alone source to a collaborative network, resulting in enriched outputs.
6. **Dynamic Discussion Panel:** Members of the Think Tank change according to the discussed topic

### Use Cases for the LLM Think Tank
1. **Developing a Comprehensive Climate Change Strategy:** This topic would require input from climatologists to understand the scientific factors, economists to discuss the fiscal implications, sociologists to predict societal impacts, and politicians to understand legislative possibilities.
2. **Designing a Smart City:** Urban planners, computer scientists, environmental scientists, sociologists, and representatives from the local population would all have important insights to contribute. Discussions could cover everything from IoT implementation to the socioeconomic impacts of urban green spaces.
3. **Mitigating Biodiversity Loss and Ecosystem Degradation:** The Think Tank enables an interdisciplinary discourse involving ecologists, conservation biologists, economists, political scientists, and sociologists, ensuring holistic solutions to biodiversity loss.
4. **Evolving Education for the 21st Century:** Educators, psychologists, technology experts, and policymakers would all have valuable insights to contribute to how education can evolve to meet the needs of today's society.
