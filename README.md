# ThinkTankGPT: A Collaborative AI Framework for Nuanced, Multi-Expert Discourse
ThinkTankGPT elevates the scope of AI dialogues by orchestrating a dynamic discourse among specialized LLM. A collaborative framework at its core, ThinkTankGPT offers an enriched, nuanced discussion on user-defined topics by automatically assembling a virtual panel of experts and  simulating a panel discussion among them. This project draws its inspiration from the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework, pushing it further to create a debate between LLMs that remember previous arguments and responses to ensure a non-repetitive, deeply interrelated discourse.

## Why ThinkTankGPT?
While existing Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide a single, unified perspective, this approach has its limitations. For example, relying on more advanced and costly models can yield good results, but it's not a foolproof method. As pointed out by the creators of the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework, LLMs can sometimes fall into a "Degeneration-of-Thought" trap. In this scenario, once the model forms a strong opinion, it finds it difficult to generate new, alternative insights or correct itself if its initial stance is proven wrong.

The MAD framework proposed an innovative workaround: have two LLMs with opposing viewpoints engage in a structured debate. This approach yielded richer, more nuanced outputs than even the most advanced single LLM could offer. ThinkTankGPT takes this idea a step further. Instead of a binary debate, it simulates a panel of rivaling experts by prompting a single LLM to adopt multiple personas. This creates a dynamic and multi-faceted discussion, offering more nuanced and comprehensive insights on complex topics.

### Key Features of ThinkTankGPT
1. **Persona-Prompting:** Utilizes a single LLM but simulates a variety of domain-specific expert-generated prompts.
2. **Dynamic Memory:** Experts remember previous dialogues to avoid repetitiveness and increase the interrelatedness of ongoing discussions.
3. **Nuanced Conversations:** Simulates a  diverse panel of experts.
4. **User-Defined Topics:** Highly adaptable to various user-defined subjects.

### Benefits
1. **Prompt-Engineered Accuracy:** Improved results through persona-specific prompts.
2. **Comprehensive Viewpoints:** Encourages a more balanced and nuanced discussion by simulating multiple experts.
3. **Dynamic Adaptability:** The expert panel is automatically customized to fit the topic of discussion.
4. **Token Efficiency:** Summarized, focused outputs for better management of token limitations.

## Future Work
The integration of specialized LLMs for domain-specific expertise remains a long-term goal for ThinkTankGPT. Planned enhancements include:

- Utilizing pre-trained LLMs with domain knowledge for improved expertise.
- Further improvements in token efficiency.
- Continuous updates to keep the LLM current with real-time information.
- Overarching service framework that incorporates specialized LLMs provided by different institutions, including automatic payment. 
## Examples
I'll add a wide range of discussions here soon.
