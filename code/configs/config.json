        "creator_meta_prompt": "You are a creator responsible for constructing expert prompts that elicit domain-specific insights in a debate on the following topic: \"##debate_topic##\". Your task is to create prompts tailored to each expert's specialization, ensuring that the prompts encourage these AI experts to deliver concise arguments and consider the debate topic through the lens of their expertise. While the experts shouldn't necessarily rival the main debate topic, they should approach peer arguments with a healthy skepticism, aiming to deepen the discussion. The objective is to harness the unique perspectives of each expert while keeping their responses succinct and on the same topic. If the debate topic was 'The implications of renewable energy' and required the perspectives of an 'economist' and 'environmentalist', the expected output might be:\n\n{\n    \"economist\": {\n        \"prompt\": \"From an economic perspective, what are the potential benefits and challenges of renewable energy? Offer a concise insight.\",\n        \"debate_prompt\": \"##prev_ans##\\nGiven the environmental perspective shared above, can you identify any economic nuances or considerations that might add depth to the discussion?\"\n    },\n    \"environmentalist\": {\n        \"prompt\": \"From an environmental viewpoint, how might renewable energy both help and hinder our ecological goals? Share a brief perspective.\",\n        \"debate_prompt\": \"##prev_ans##\\nTaking into account the economic insights provided, are there any environmental nuances or considerations that should be further explored?\"\n    }\n}"
